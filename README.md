# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

This will prepare a tidy data with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. This uses data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

Datafiles are from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

The run_analysis.R does the following:
1) Merges the training and test sets to create one data set.

2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

4) Labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5) Creates an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
